# Philanthropy Data Commons Service

This is the data-handling service layer for the [Philanthropy Data Commons](https://philanthropydatacommons.org) (PDC).

The PDC is an access-controlled environment in which changemakers and funders can share funding proposals, both for improved efficiency (e.g., offering a "common grant application" in specific domains) and for opening up new possibilities in partnering and alliance-building. The PDC is designed to enable cross-organizational data sharing while allowing organizations to maintain their own systems, practices, and data standards.

To do this, the PDC maintains a **mapping** between various organizations' data fields and the PDC's internal data representation. For example, if one organization uses `Proposal Name` and another uses `Title of Proposal`, both of those might map to the PDC field `ProposalTitle`. The PDC remembers this mapping, translating back and forth as needed so that data flow in and out seamlessly, a unified search interface can be offered, etc.

With the above overview in mind, we can now summarize what this service layer does:

- Store **opportunities** (analogous to RFPs / CFPs) and the **fields** (which hold applicants' responses) associated with those opportunities.
- Store **proposals** -- the actual responses to opportunities, with long-term consistency provided via the above-described mapping.
- **Authenticate** users and provide **access control**, so that a given organization's data is only shared with whom that organization has authorized.
- Provide a **programmatic interface** (an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)) by which authorized users (both changemakers and funders) can **browse**, **search**, and, where appropriate, **update** opportunities and proposals, subject to the access controls defined by data owners.
- Track the **provenance** and **update history** of all information, noticing and handling discrepancies. For example, if two different [GMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_management_software) tools connect to the PDC and provide conflicting information about an application or an applicant, the PDC may be able to pick the right answer automatically (based on a up-to-date date or on some other precedence rule), or it may flag the conflict and require a human to resolve it. See [more on Changemaker data](docs/CHANGEMAKER_DATA.md).

Of all these features, the API is probably the most important, because it is the heart of the PDC's interoperability. It enables GMSs and other systems to connect to the PDC to give and receive information about opportunities and proposals. For example, it can enable a second funder to discover a proposal that a changemaker had proposed to some other potential funder originally; it even provides ways for the originally considered funder to deliberately share (assuming the changemaker authorizes) a good proposal with a specific funder that might be more appropriate for it.

While the PDC service layer will have its own web-browser-based searching and browsing interface, the API (and its associated [data schema](docs/ENTITY_RELATIONSHIP_DIAGRAM.md)) are where interoperability lives, and our top priority is documenting that API and helping people to use it. Through the API, other systems, including but not limited to GMS tools, can connect to the PDC and use PDC data to supplement what they provide.

## Hosting

For notes on how to set up a production instance, see the [hosting documentation](docs/HOSTING.md).

## Development

In order to run this software you need to set up a [Postgres 14](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. You will also need a working copy of `python3`

### Setup

1. Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Set up environment variables

See the `.env.example` file for relevant environment variables. One option to manage environment variables is to use a `.env` file and source it prior to running a command. For example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
edit .env
set -a
source .env
```

3. Run migrations

```bash
npm run migrate
```

### Common Commands

To build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To remove dev dependencies for a docker or production build:

```bash
npm prune --omit=dev
```

To build a docker image:

```bash
docker build .
```

To run migrations:

```bash
npm run build
npm run migrate
```

To start the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

To start the server in a development environment:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Logging

To override the default log level in any environment, set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` with any of the above `npm` commands:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=trace npm run test
```

Alternatively, one may set `LOG_LEVEL` in the `.env` file.

### Authentication and Authorization

A valid Bearer JSON Web Token (Bearer JWT) is required in requests to the PDC service. The PDC officially recommends using [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as the authentication provider, but supports any valid Bearer JWT provider. Please refer to [the relevant documentation for setup and configuration](https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started)

See `.env.example` for documentation on the necessary environment variables for Keycloak (or chosen authentication provider)

#### An example with a Keycloak authentication and Swagger-UI

We use Swagger to generate an interactive api interface as the default route for the service.
From the Keycloak admin interface, e.g. https://my-host/admin:

1. Add a realm e.g. "pdc" (avoid spaces in the name).
2. Within the realm just added in step (1) add a client e.g. "pdc-openapi-docs", with Client authentication off and Authorization off:
   - Standard flow Checked,
   - Direct access grants unchecked,
   - Implicit flow unchecked,
   - Service accounts roles unchecked,
   - OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (optional), and
   - OIDC CIBA Grant unchecked.
3. In the settings for the client added in step (2), set the root URL and Home URL to the URL of the PDC service (not the auth service). [For development purposes, all callback routes can be authorized](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/23.0.7/authorization_services/#_resource_overview)
   - `/*`
4. In the settings for the client added in step (2), add a Web origins of `+`.
5. Within the realm, add a user, e.g. `test-user`. Set a password for this user.
6. Set your environment variables (see `.env.example`)
7. Run the service repository with `npm run start`.
8. Go to swagger ui page at `http://localhost:3001/`
9. Click "Authorize" in the top left and click the "Authorize" button in the popup
10. Proceed through keycloak login
11. Once logged in and redirected to swagger ui, query any of the endpoints to test authentication

#### Authorization

The application looks for Keycloak group membership to drive authorization within the application. The names are hard-coded into the application therefore specific group names added to Keycloak are required.

To add a `pdc-admin` group to the PDC realm in Keycloak, visit the [Keycloak admin interface, select the PDC Realm, and click Groups](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/master/console/#/pdc/groups). Click "Create Group" and name it `pdc-admin`.

To add a user to the `pdc-admin` group, visit the [Keycloak admin interface, select the PDC Realm, and click Users](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/master/console/#/pdc/users), click the User, click the Groups tab, and click "Join Group". Alternatively, click [Groups](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/master/console/#/pdc/groups) in the PDC Realm, click the "Members" tab, and click "Add member."

To have a visible `role` in the JWT of a user, a role must be associated with the user or one of the user's groups. Create a `pdc-admin` role in the PDC realm in the Keycloak admin interface. Select the PDC Realm, click [Realm roles](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/master/console/#/pdc/roles), and click "Create role." Go back to the `pdc-admin` [Group](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/master/console/#/pdc/groups), click the "Role mapping" tab, click "Assign role", and finally bind the `pdc-admin` role to the `pdc-admin` group.

When users are logged in, their JWTs will include a list of associated roles. The application can first validate the JWT (same as authentication) and then check the validated JWT for role presence.

Members of the `pdc-admin` group should additionally be able to manage users in the [Keycloak PDC realm admin interface](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/pdc/console). The limited ability to manage users in the PDC realm is distinct from being an administrator of the entire Keycloak instance. Administrators of the entire Keycloak instance are admins in the master realm. In contrast, users in the PDC realm can have PDC user management privileges without being members of the master realm at all. To grant members of the `pdc-admin` group the ability to edit users and groups in the Keycloak PDC realm, visit the [Keycloak (master) admin interface, select the PDC Realm, and click Groups](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/master/console/#/pdc/groups/). Click the `pdc-admin` group, click the "Role Mapping" tab, click "Assign role", click the drop-down menu and select "Filter by clients", select the following `realm-management` roles: `view-users`, `query-users`, and `manage-users`. For new logins following this change, members of the `pdc-admin` group can visit the [Keycloak PDC realm admin interface](https://auth.philanthropydatacommons.org/admin/pdc/console), log in with their PDC realm credentials, and gain access to a limited subset of Keycloak functionality, namely the ability to edit users and groups.

### Understanding the Project

#### Project Structure

- `/src/databases` contains database `migrations`, `queries`, and the core `db` access object.
- `/src/handlers` contains all business logic related to the invocation of a given PDC api call.
- `/src/routers` contains the piping that maps a given API route to a controller.

#### Database

We are using a very lightweight library called [tinypg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinypg) for our database interactions and a similarly lightweight library called [postgres-migrations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres-migrations) to handle migrations.

Migrations should be named according to the following pattern: `####-{action}-{table}`

For example: `0001-create-users` or `0001-modify-users`

The `CopyBaseFieldsTask` worker is designed to copy basefields from a remote to a local instance of the pdc service. An administrative user looking to seed their database can make a POST request to the `/tasks/baseFieldsCopy` route, specifying the remote url in the body of the form:

```json
{ "pdcApiUrl": "https://remote.pdc.instance" }
```

#### Linting

We use [SQLFluff](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/index.html) to lint our SQL files. Our project automatically installs and runs it appropriately using `python3`'s virtualization tooling.

[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) checks our GitHub Actions workflow files for syntax, security, and more. It is run in CI via the [actionlint action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actionlint), and you can run it locally by either compiling the tool locally using Go, or downloading a [release binary](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/releases): `actionlint`. We are using the defaults, so it requires no arguments.

#### Node version

We aim to use the "Active LTS" version of node. An major version of node is specified in automated workflows and Dockerfile, and the .node-version file. You should be able to use any minor version within the Active LTS version and might be able to use other major versions.

### EditorConfig

We use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to help developers maintain proper whitespace habits in the project. Most IDEs have [an official EditorConfig plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download) you can install.

### Ignored revisions

We have set up a file to track commits that are focused on formatting changes. It is possible to [ignore these commits when running git blame](https://akrabat.com/ignoring-revisions-with-git-blame/).

You can configure your local git to always ignore these commits by invoking:

```
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

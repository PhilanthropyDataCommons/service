# Organization Identity Provider Integration

The PDC uses Keycloak as an Identity Provider (IdP) and/or Service Provider.

Organizations such as funders, data providers, and changemakers that have their
own IdP can integrate with PDC using their own IdP for authentication while PDC
Keycloak and PDC handle authorization within PDC.

This guide lists specific steps to integrate specific IdPs with PDC Keycloak.

For organizations without their own IdP, the PDC administrators can either
manage a Keycloak organization on their behalf (for smaller organizations) or
add a separate realm as an "external" IdP (for larger organizations). In the
latter case, the integration should be configured to allow an organization
member to manage user membership in that realm as if it were the organization's
own IdP. With a separate realm, the users will be "unmanaged" in the new realm
and "managed" in the `pdc` realm. As of this writing, these two options are
available in lieu of a future Keycloak release that includes Fine-Grained Admin
Permissions (FGAP) for the Keycloak organizations capability. When FGAP is
available for Keycloak organizations, the organization in the `pdc` realm should
be configured to allow an organization member to administer its organization,
and this should obsolete the first two options above.

## External Okta Identity Providers

Before integrating, the PDC team needs to name an identifying alias for each
integrated system, for example `foundation-okta-oidc` or `foundation-okta-saml`,
to be used to link PDC Keycloak with the external IdP.

### Testing an Okta Integration

After creating an Okta integration (below), test it using the following steps.

1. Visit the API docs
2. Click "Authorize"
3. Click "Authorize" on the "Available authorizations" modal
4. Enter an email address with the organization's domain
5. Verify that the browser is redirected to Okta.

If the user is assigned to the application in Okta, proceed with authentication
and a redirect back to the PDC API docs should occur. There should be no need to
enter a name or email address, however PDC prompts for a mobile number for 2FA.

### Okta Configuration using OIDC (preferred over SAML)

Log in to the admin area to Start an OIDC App Integration (these steps follow
https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm
with the insertion of group steps and appendage of access policy steps).

#### Create a PDC Group

1. On the left nav bar, visit "Directory" -> "Groups"
2. Click "Add group"
3. Set "Name" to `PDC`
4. Set "Description" to `Users who may access the Philanthropy Data Commons`
5. Click "Save"
6. Click the newly created "PDC" group
7. Click "Assign people" and add at least one user.

#### Create a PDC Application

1. On the left nav bar, visit "Applications" -> "Applications"
2. Click "Create App Integration"

   ![Create App Integration](images/okta_create_app_integration.png)

3. Click "OIDC"
4. Select "Web Application"
5. Click "Next"
6. Add "App Name" of `Philanthropy Data Commons`
7. Leave "Proof of possession" unchecked
8. Set "Grant type" to `Authorization code` only
9. Set "Sign-in redirect URI" to the endpoint provided by the PDC team, similar
   to `https://example.org/realms/pdc/broker/foundation-okta-oidc/endpoint`
   **Important**: the name following `broker/` here needs to match the agreed
   alias mentioned above
10. Clear the "Sign-out redirect URIs" by clicking the X
11. Under "Assignments" select `Limit access to selected groups`
12. Set the "Selected group(s)" to the `PDC` group created earlier
13. Click "Save"
14. Confirm under "Login" that "Login initiated by" is `App Only`
15. Share the "Client ID" from "Client Credentials" with the PDC team
16. Under "Client Credentials" click "Edit"
17. Set "Client authentication" to `Public key / Private key`
18. Check "Require PKCE as additional verification"
19. Under "Public Keys" -> "Configuration", check "Use a URL to fetch keys..."
20. Set the URL to the JWKS URL of the PDC Keycloak server, provided by the PDC
    team, similar to
    `https://example.org/realms/pdc/protocol/openid-connect/certs`
21. Click "Save"
22. Click "Save" at an "Existing client secrets will no longer be used" warning.

#### Create an Access Policy and Rule for the Authorization Server

1. On the left nav bar, visit "Security" -> "API" (way down there)
2. Click the desired Authorization Server name, usually "default"
3. Copy the "Metadata URI" value and send it to the PDC team
4. Click the "Access Policies" tab
5. Click "Add New Access Policy"
6. Set "Name" to `PDC`
7. Set "Description" to `Allow users to authenticate to PDC`
8. Set "Assign to" to `The following clients:`
9. Type `P` in the input box and then pick the "PDC" client created above
10. Click "Create Policy"
11. Under the new PDC policy, click "Add rule"
12. Set the "Rule Name" to `Issue tokens to users authenticating to PDC`
13. Reduce the token lifetimes such as to `5 minutes` (access) and `90 minutes`
14. Click "Create rule".

### Okta Configuration using SAML 2.0

#### Save the current PDC keys in a PEM file

1. Visit the PDC Keycloak SAML configuration URL, similar to
   `https://example.org/realms/pdc/protocol/saml/descriptor`
2. Within the XML document presented, copy and paste each PEM-encoded value
   under "<md:KeyDescriptor use='signing'>...<ds:X509Certificate>", similar to
   `MIIC...=`, into a single (new) text file.
3. Surround each of the values from above with PEM headers and footers, namely
   `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, each on their
   own lines.
4. Line-wrap each of the values from above at 64 characters, according to
   https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7468.html#page-5
5. Save the new file with a `.crt` extension, such as `pdc_signing_keys.crt`.

This file will be used below to configure signature validation. When using SAML
with Okta, there is no option to dynamically fetch these keys. So when PDC keys
are updated, the integration will not work until re-uploading the PDC keys. Thus
[OIDC is preferred](#Okta Configuration using OIDC (preferred over SAML)) when
using Okta.

#### Configure Okta App Integration

1. Log in to the admin area to Start a SAML App Integration (these steps follow
   https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm
   )
2. On the left nav bar, visit "Applications" -> "Applications"
3. Click "Create App Integration"

   ![Create App Integration](images/okta_create_app_integration.png)

4. Click "SAML 2.0"

   ![SAML 2.0](images/okta_create_a_new_app_integration_SAML.png)

5. Click "Next"
6. Set "App Name" to `Philanthropy Data Commons`
7. If you wish to add a logo, one may be found on the [PDC website](https://philanthropydatacommons.org/)
8. Check "Do not display application icon to users" under "App visibility" to
   avoid erroneous IdP-initiated login attempts (because users begin the login
   flow from PDC Apps and not from the Okta IdP)
9. Click "Next"
10. Paste the Single sign-on URL endpoint provided by the PDC team, similar to
    `https://example.org/realms/pdc/broker/foundation-okta-saml/endpoint`
    into Okta's "Single sign-on URL"
11. Paste the "SP Entity ID URL" provided by the PDC team, similar to
    `https://example.org/realms/pdc` into Okta's "Audience URI (SP Entity ID)"
    field
12. Set the "Name ID format" to `EmailAddress`
13. Set the "Application username" to `Email`
14. Expand "Show Advanced Settings"
15. Ensure both "Response" and "Assertion Signature" are `Signed`
16. Add a "Signature Certificate" PEM file by clicking "Browse files...",
    created [above](#Save the current PDC keys in a PEM file)
17. Add Attribute Statements (case sensitive, use the dropdown for each Value):
    - Map `firstName`, `Basic` to `user.firstName`
    - Map `lastName`, `Basic` to `user.lastName`

    ![Attribute Statements map](images/okta_attribute_statements.png)

18. Click "Next"
19. Click "Finish"
20. Send Okta's SAML "Metadata URL" value to the PDC team.

    ![SAML Metadata URL](images/okta_metadata_url.png)

The PDC team will use this URL to configure an Identity Provider (IdP) within
PDC Keycloak and link it to a PDC Keycloak organization such that when users log
into PDC they will be redirected to their canonical IdP based on the domain name
in the email address. For example, entering "user@myfoundation.org" should
redirect the user to Okta. [Okta
configuration](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-assign-apps.htm)
will determine whether a myfoundation user can log into the PDC. If
"user@myfoundation.org" has been assigned in Okta, then the Okta-configured
login procedure will be used for authentication, and if successful, the user
will be redirected to PDC Keycloak and be granted a valid PDC session.

## Keycloak Configuration

Configure the PDC realm to use organizations and set up an organization.
